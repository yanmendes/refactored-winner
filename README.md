# Project

This is implemented as a stand-alone module that can be imported to parse racing logs. It expects an array of logs as seen [here](https://github.com/Gympass/interview-test).

## Getting started

Firstly, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then, Install dependencies with your preferred package manager `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Testing the implementation

The test file has an example input and prints a table with the results. To execute it, run `npm test`
